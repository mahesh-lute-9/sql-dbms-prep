# Java Backend Developer Prep — A Complete Journey

A structured roadmap and progress tracker for preparation toward Java backend 
developer roles at top product-based companies. Covers all CS fundamentals 
essential for product company interviews — tracked as I build toward 
interview-ready depth.

This repo doubles as a revision guide — not just a diary of what I did, but 
a reference for *why* things work the way they do. Useful for anyone following 
a similar Java backend roadmap.

## 🎯 Goal
Land a Java backend developer role at a top product-based company as a fresher, 
with strong fundamentals across DSA, databases, core CS subjects, and backend 
system design.

## 📖 How to use this repo
- **New here and want the full roadmap?** Start with the section below.
- **Looking for notes and solved problems?** Each subject has its own folder — 
  concept notes and solutions with reasoning on *why* each approach works, not 
  just what the answer is.
- **Want to follow along?** [`progress.md`](./progress.md) has the weekly 
  log of what's being covered.
- **Revisiting a topic?** Each subject folder will have a cheat-sheet summary 
  once that phase wraps up — common patterns, gotchas, quick-reference notes.

## 🔗 Active Right Now
Java fundamentals are actively being built here →
**[java-learning-journey](https://github.com/mahesh-lute-9/java-learning-journey)**
*(Core Java from basics to JVM internals — daily practice, notes, and internals)*

Everything in this repo is planned and will be picked up in sequence. 
Progress is logged in [`progress.md`](./progress.md) as each track begins.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### 🔜 DSA

| Purpose | Resource |
|---|---|
| 📋 Problem Sheet | [Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/) |
| 🎥 Video / Concept | *(to be updated)* |
| 🔥 Interview Drilling | [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) |

> 💡 Topic order: Arrays → Strings → Two Pointers → Sliding Window → 
> Linked Lists → Stacks/Queues → Binary Search → Trees → Graphs → DP.
> Pattern recognition over problem memorization — learn the pattern, 
> apply it across problems.

### 🔜 SQL & DBMS

#### SQL
| Purpose | Resource |
|---|---|
| 🎥 Video / Concept | *(to be updated)* |
| 📖 Theory Reference | [GeeksforGeeks — SQL](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-tutorial/) |
| 💻 Applied Practice | [DataLemur](https://datalemur.com/) |
| 🔥 Interview Drilling | [LeetCode SQL — Top 50](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/top-sql-50/) |

#### DBMS
| Purpose | Resource |

| 📖 Deep Dive Reference | [GeeksforGeeks — DBMS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms/) |

> 💡 Go topic by topic on TakeUforward's DBMS sheet. Watch the video resource 
> for the concept, use GFG to go deeper, then practice explaining each topic 
> out loud in 2-3 sentences — that's the actual interview skill.

### 🔜 Java + Spring Boot

- **Foundation already in progress →** [java-learning-journey](https://github.com/mahesh-lute-9/java-learning-journey)
  *(Core Java from basics to JVM internals — active repo)*
- 🎥 Video / Concept — *(to be updated)*
- [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/) — reference while building
- **Goal:** 2 portfolio projects (REST API + JWT auth, DB-backed CRUD app)

> 💡 OOPs is already covered in depth via 
> [java-learning-journey](https://github.com/mahesh-lute-9/java-learning-journey).
> This track focuses on Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate, and building real projects.

### 🔜 System Design

| Purpose | Resource |
|---|---|
| 🎥 Video / Concept | *(to be updated)* |
| 📖 Reference | [System Design Primer — GitHub](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer) |

> 💡 For freshers: LLD (Low Level Design) comes first — class diagrams, 
> design patterns, OOP-based problems (Parking Lot, Library Management). 
> HLD (caching, load balancing, sharding) follows after LLD is solid.

## 📈 Progress
See [`progress.md`](./progress.md) for the weekly log — tracks started, 
topics covered, problems solved, and notes on weak areas.

## 🗂️ Repo Structure

## 📌 Notes
- SQL solutions are named for what they solve (e.g. `second-highest-salary.sql`) 
  with a comment on the reasoning — not just the query, but why that approach.
- DSA solutions include the pattern used and the reasoning, not just the code.
- OS and CN notes are structured around interview topics, not textbook chapters.
- Standalone Spring Boot projects live in their own repos, linked from `projects.md`.
